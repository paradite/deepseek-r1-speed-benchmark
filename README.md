## Missing data for some providers

A timeout of 10 seconds is used for all providers.

If the API does not respond within 10 seconds, the provider is skipped for that run.

This is why some providers are missing data.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.

Follow the sample in the `.env.example` file to set up your API keys.

3. Make sure you have Node.js version 20 or higher installed.

## Usage

Run the benchmark:

```bash
npm run benchmark        # Regular benchmark
npm run benchmark-show-output # Show the API response while benchmarking
npm run analyze-speed     # Analyze the speed of the API
```

The script will measure:

- Total tokens generated
- Response time
- First response latency
- Tokens per second
- Prompt and completion token counts

## How it works

The benchmark script sends a standardized prompt to the DeepSeek API and measures:

- The time taken to receive the complete response
- The number of tokens in both the prompt and response
- Calculates the overall tokens per second processing speed

This helps in understanding the real-world performance of the DeepSeek API in your specific environment and use case.
